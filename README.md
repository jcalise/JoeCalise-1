### How I got into programing:
I started dabbling in coding when I was in high school and it's been something I've occasionally come back to evey now and then. In college it was a more frequent hobby as I did some freelance work creating website and backend tools for several small businesses as a way to may extra income. I had started a degree in computer engineering but decided after a year that it wasn't really for me. For the last few years I keep coming back to the idea that I really wanted to give learning to code for real a go and this summer finally started learning Python.

### What are my goals for programming?
There is a specific goal that I have in mind right now, I just really want to learn as much as I can about Python. My hope is that once I learn the language better I will be able to find use for it in my work. There is always the possibility of making a major switch into a programming-centric career but that seems like a long way off.
